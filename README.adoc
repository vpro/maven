=== Maven Release
Image specifically created to perform a maven release. For this you need the ability to check out a branch (not detached head) and preform release commit using a private ssh key.

When running it expects an GITLAB_RUNNER_PRIVATE_KEY argument containing the private key to use for git checkout and pushing of commits:

```
  docker run -it \
    --env "GITLAB_RUNNER_PRIVATE_KEY=$(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa)" \
    registry.npohosting.nl/poms/maven:latest \
    /bin/bash -c "git clone git@gitlab.com/npo-identity/poms/poms-maven.git && cd maven-release && mvn release:prepare release:perform"
```
